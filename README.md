My Groceries Sales Data Analysis Journey

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of groceries sales data to gain valuable insights into sales performance and customer behavior. By merging multiple datasetsâ€”including categories, cities, countries, customers, employees, products, and salesâ€”I created a unified dataframe for in-depth analysis.

I started off by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and removing irrelevant columns to focus on key insights. Then, I visualized the data to identify patterns and trends. Some of the key analyses I performed included:

ðŸ”¹ Sales Performance Analysis: I calculated total sales revenue, analyzed sales trends over time (year, month, day), and identified top-selling and least-selling products and categories. I also examined sales performance by customer and city to understand regional variations.

ðŸ”¹ Customer Behavior Analysis: I segmented customers based on total spending, purchase frequency, and average spending per purchase. This helped me identify top customers and better understand their purchasing behavior.

ðŸ”¹ Product Resistance and Allergen Information: I analyzed product resistance and allergen information by category to uncover customer preferences and potential health concerns.

This project is highly relevant in real life, as it provides actionable insights for businesses looking to optimize their sales strategies, improve customer retention, and refine product offerings. By understanding sales trends and customer behavior, companies can make data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability.

I really enjoyed working on this analysis, as it reinforced my passion for data science, business intelligence, and data-driven decision-making!
